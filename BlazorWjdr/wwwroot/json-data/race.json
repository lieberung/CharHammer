{"id":63,"lieux_ids":null,"pj":true,"nom_masculin":"Gnôme","nom_feminin":"Gnôme","description":"As far as most of the Empire is concerned, Gnomes are a myth, found only in over-blown Bretonnian romances or Altdorf pfennig-dreadfuls where they frequently appear as magical tricksters. However, there is truth behind the stories, for Gnomes are not only real, but they live in the Empire.\\n\nGnomes - or Gnommi as they call themselves in their native tongue of Gbassally have a handful of settlements within the Empire's borders, but do not mix with the broader Human population to any significant degree. So uncommon are they. Gnomes are often mistaken for over-thin Halflings by ill-educated folk. Because of this, Gnomes seeking unquestioned passage through the Empire often shave any facial hair and wear bulky clothes or padding to hide their far thinner frames. Whilst this would never fool a Halfling, it is usually enough to convince others.\\n\nShort, wiry, with bulbous noses, and large, rounded cars, Gnomes have thick hair, dextrous fingers, and gruff voices that can be surprisingly deep for such diminutive folk. 'They are a close-knit, clannish people, putting family and personal loyalty ahead of most other concerns with a stubborn tenacity that can surprise even the most intractable Dwarf. Much as the legends suggest, Gnomes are inherently magical, and share a dose relationship with Ulgu, the magical wind of shadows, illusions, and deceit.\\n\nGlinidwarrow is the largest Gnome settlement within the Empire, though rumours claim others lie beneath the Grey Mountains in Reildand, the Middle Mountains in Middenland, and the Kolsa Hills of Talabecland. Glimdwarrow itself lies hidden below the Mirror Moors to the south of Middenland, its burrows and halls cloaked by powerful illusions and vigilantly guarded by the Dwarrow Guard, an elite unit of warrior-wizards. Glimciwarmw once boasted a bustling population of many thousands, but a century ago the Greenskin hordes of Grom the Paunch swept thrcsgh the Mirror Moors and massacred almost all the Gnomes hiding there. Today, Glimdwarrow's crumbling chambers are largely empty; and only eight Gnome clans survive. Ruled by troubled Merawidda Franc, the Ashen Queen, the leaders of the remaining dans openly hate each other, each blaming the others for the honors Grom's Greenskins unleashed.","opinions":"On Dwarfs...\n'Great Mother Tegen thinks she's stubborn, always talking about bw it were Clan Landweth that caused all our problems, and bw she won't be persuaded otherwise. But, as Mabyn is me witness, she ain't got nothing on they Dwarfs. I've seen mountains more moveable when it comes to matters of gold.'\n- Aelyn 'Thome, Glimdwarrow Trader\n\nOn Wood Elves...\nI ain't ever met them, and I doubts I ever will. Probably no better than them other hoity-toity Elves from across the water.'\n- Morkam 'Kneebone', Mirror Moor Farmer\n\nOn High Elves...\n'Ere, after 200 years, I'm still jumping mad at them Elves. If it adn't been for they idiots, we'd still be accepted across the Empire. But, no, it's their way or nothing, and sadly that Emperor Magnus listened to those bloody Elves about what magic is. So, here we are, 'iding away, jumping at shadows.' - Kywere I lawicen, Glimdwarrow Illusionist\n\nOn Halflings...\n'Little hellers, they are! Met a family of them on the road travelling to Nomenfast, and while one was making a good deal to me face for a tray of pins, the rest were in me wares attempting to half-inch all me gear. Ringol's Beard, I bet they got a shock when they got back to camp and found themselves light of their purses...'\n- Durngarth Peddlar, Wandering Vagabond\n\nOn Humans...\n'If it ain't their witch hunters chasing us for whatevers, or their lords looking to muscle us out, it's their traders looking to steal what's ours. But, they's our neighbours, so they are, so we'ave to make do somehow. Best to keep our heads low, I says. Real low.'\n- Old Demelza 'Crowfeet', Mirror Moor Fishwife\n\nOn Ogres...\n'So, she says to me, 'Ain't much eating on you, eh?' Didn't bloody stop 'er trying though! Chased me across the moor, she did. For two days! Bloody wouldn't give up! Never met an Ogre that didn't look at me the way I look at a Rumster's pie, so I runs whenever I see 'un of they idiots. Safest that way.'\n- Jowanet Scantleburn, Herbalist of the Midden Marshes"},
