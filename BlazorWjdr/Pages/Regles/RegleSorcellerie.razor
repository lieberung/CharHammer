                Magical abilities mark you as a figure of terror and awe in the
                Empire. Prior to the establishment of the Colleges of Magic
                in Altdorf, those able to wield magic were reviled outlaws.
                Nowadays being a witch is not illegal, but casting magic without
                a licence is. Spellcasters within the Empire must either study at
                the Colleges of Magic, refrain from casting spells, or hope no-one
                notices their illicit activity. Even licenced wizards are generally
                feared and avoided — legal status has done nothing to reduce the
                superstitious dread of the common folk.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Magic is seen as unnatural and is notorious for its darker
                elements: the crippling hexes of witchcraft, the raising of the
                dead, and the summoning of Daemonic entities. Even when
                practiced according to the teaching of the Colleges, magic can
                be the cause of trouble. The very source of magic is unstable, and
                even the most experienced spellcaster can lose focus, resulting in
                dangerous accidents and unexpected side-effects.
            </p>

            <h4 class="card-title">L'Aethyr</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
                Scholars of magic derive their learning from the Elves, who
                explained the source of all magical power is the Aethyr. This
                infinite dimension, said to be the spawning ground of daemons
                and spirits, exists beyond the physical world. The Elves taught
                that far to the north of the Empire, a great ragged wound was
                torn through the fabric of the world to the Aethyr, and it bleeds
                raw magic. These roiling energies — known as the Winds of
                Magic — blow throughout the world, gathering and eddying in
                great heavenly whorls, only to rain down and permeate the land
                and the creatures dwelling upon it. It is these powerful winds that
                wizards and witches use to fuel their spells.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-4">
            <h4 class="card-title">Les Vents de Magie</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
                As magical power bursts into the mortal realm and sweeps
                down from the north, it splinters and separates, like light splitting
                through a prism. The Colleges of Magic state this creates eight
                discrete Winds referred to by colour, each with its own character
                and strengths. The Elves support this, teaching the same eight
                winds to their apprentices before moving on to more powerful magics.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Only a small minority of Humans can perceive the Winds, and
                even fewer can bend them to their will. Most Elves are sensitive
                to them, and many possess the ability to see the Winds clearly
                — commonly known as Second Sight, or just the Sight — with
                many also able to learn how to cast magic. Dwarfs disdain magic,
                perhaps because they are partially immune to it, and no Dwarf
                wizards are known. Halflings are largely indifferent towards magic:
                except when it delivers impressive or entertaining spectacles.
                The Elves directed (as a condition of their tuition) that Human
                spellcasters should each only use a single Wind of Magic. They
                argued that while it is possible to cast spells by drawing from
                multiple winds, doing so is a risky proposition for the feeble,
                corruptible Human mind. This wisdom has been adopted by the
                Colleges, and each specialises in a single colour.
                Some witches outside the College system consider these
                restrictions ludicrous, an attempt by the Elves to keep the most
                powerful magics to themselves. Drawing on multiple winds is a
                quick route to power, but also to damnation. Many an unlicensed
                witch has proved unable to resist this temptation, a practice usually
                called Dark Magic, only to be brought low by Witch Hunters.
                Others believe magical energies are not so easily categorised.
                Many different types of ‘wizard’ and ‘witch’ can be found
                throughout the Old World, with some practicing magic that
                seems to lie outside colour magic, such as the cold-hearted Ice
                Witches of Kislev, or the shamans and sorcerers found amongst
                some of the other species besetting the Empire, such as the Greenskins.

                <em>
                    there is much heated debate between ‘experts’ on the nature of magic. the lecture halls of the empire’s most learned institutions
                    often see ambitious scholars expound on their latest theories. some liken magic to the backstage of a theatre, a mass of mechanisms,
                    props, and hidden pulleys responsible for the drama viewed by the audience. others resort to mathematical metaphors, complete with
                    incomprehensible esoteric diagrams. Although such may end with an air of confident finality, it will only be met with polite coughs,
                    raised hands, and a litany of objections and exceptions.

            <h4 class="card-title">La Langue Mystique de la Magie</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Winds of Magic may blow through all things incessantly, but
                they are relatively harmless until harnessed by the Language of
                Magick. For reasons not fully understood, when certain sounds
                are uttered by those attuned to magic, the Winds answer. The
                Colleges of Magic teach a complex language called the lingua
                praestantia which form the basis of their spells, originally taught
                to Humanity by the Elves. Although extraordinarily difficult
                to correctly annunciate, it is a significant simplification of the
                Elven tongue Anoqeyån, the language used by the Elves to shape
                their own, more powerful magics. Wizards of the Colleges and
                the Elves are not alone in their knowledge of the Language of
                Magick. Its complex forms are also spoken by many magical
                creatures found across the Old World, including Spirits and
                Daemons. Many witches seem to instinctively understand the
                language, almost as if it somehow wormed inside them, begging
                to be spoken as a spell.

                There are four types of spell: Petty, Arcane, Lore, and Chaos
                spells. Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts
                of magic. Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying
                any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic. Lore spells are those you
                can only learn if you know that Lore; i.e. to learn spells from the
                Lore of Fire, you need the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent. Chaos
                spells are those practiced by those who’ve lost their souls to
                Chaos.

                Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick)
                in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into
                your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell.
                To memorise a spell — and therefore be able to cast it without
                access to your grimoire — you typically need to spend the amount
                of XP noted in your spellcasting Talent (see Chapter 4: Skills
                and Talents). Once a spell has been memorised, a spellcaster
                knows it permanently, barring special circumstances.

                If the casting roll is a Critical, the Winds of Magic
                have flared dangerously high, granting you extra power, but at
                a cost. Unless you have the Instinctive Diction Talent, you roll
                on the Minor Miscast Table as the power moves beyond your
                control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Critical Cast:</strong> If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a Critical Wound. See page 172 for details.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Power:</strong> The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your rolled SL, but can be Dispelled.</li>
                <li><strong>Unstoppable Force:</strong> If you scored enough SL to cast your spell, it cannot be Dispelled.</li>

                For every +2 SL you achieve in a Casting Test, you may add
                additional Range, Area of Effect, Duration, or Targets equal to
                the initial value listed in the spell. Spells with a Range and Target
                of ‘You’ may only ever target the spellcaster making the Casting
                Test. Spells with a Range of ‘Touch’ may not be extended. If the
                Spell has no Duration, you cannot extend it.

            <p class="card-text">
                You may choose the same option more than once. For instance, if
                you achieved + 4 SL above your Casting Number on a spell with
                a Target of 1, you may now Target 3 individuals. Certain Spells

                Some spellcasters own a spellbook, or grimoire, in which they
                transcribe their spells. Apprentices copy spells from their master,
                while experienced wizards will actively seek out new spells from
                other wizards, often trading spells for favours. A spellcaster may
                cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a Lore

                missile is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit
                Location struck is determined by reversing the dice rolled on
                the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the Hit Location
                Table (see page 159). The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is
                added to the spell’s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to
                determine the total inflicted Damage. This Damage is reduced by

                Melee or Dodge Skill) after completing the Casting Test.
                If you do this and your spell was a magic missile, the Melee

                Spellcasters may channel their magic through an appropriate
                ingredient before unleashing their spells. Doing this offers
                protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the
                worst of any magical backlash.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                If you use an ingredient when casting, any suffered Major
                Miscast becomes a Minor Miscast, and any Minor Miscast
                has no effect. If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or
                destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled.

                Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore
                spells. Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your
                character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for
                specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore. For those looking
                to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each
                of the primary Lores of Magic are provided by the individual
                spell lists.
            </p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Limitations</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
                As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak — not gagged,
                strangled, or underwater — to cast. If your voice is inhibited, the
                Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should
                be increased by the GM. Further, the Language of Magick needs
                to be spoken (or sung, for those using the Lore of Light) clearly,
                and often loudly, to ensure spells work; magic is anything but
                subtle. As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder
                the spell is chanted.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have
                to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before
                using the same spell again. Further, spells providing bonuses or
                penalties do not stack. Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty
                is applied from every spell cast upon you. So, if you had a spell
                providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10

            <h3 class="card-title">Channelling Test</h3>
            <p class="card-text">
                Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally
                be found ambiently flowing through the world. To power such
                spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate
                them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill.
                Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure,
                but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells. To channel
                magic for a spell, make an Extended Channelling Test.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have
                channelled enough magic to cast it. On the next Round, you can
                cast your spell using the normal Casting rules, but count the
                chosen spell’s Casting Number as 0. If the casting Test fails, you
                also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a Minor
                Miscast as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                If you roll a Critical when Channelling, you have channelled
                a mighty flow of magic and can cast your spell next Round
                regardless of the SL you’ve scored in the Extended Test so far;
                however, so much magic so quickly concentrated in one place
                results in some magical backlash: roll 1d100 on the Minor
                Miscast Table unless you have the Aethyric Attunement Talent
                (see page 132).

                Channelling the Winds of Magic in a large flow is dangerous.
                You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a
                Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on. If you fumble a Channelling
                Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the Major
                Miscast Table.

                Concentration is vital when channelling. If you are distracted
                by anything — loud noises, suffering damage, flashing lights,
                or similar — you must pass a Hard (–20) Cool Test, or suffer a
                Minor Miscast and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended
                Channelling Test so far.

                Wearing colours appropriate to the Wind of Magic you are
                manipulating helps attract the magic to you. This is the reason

            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a –1 SL penalty if you
                are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying
                to attract, as determined by the GM. Specifically, metal and
                leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the
                golden wind Chamon, while leather retains traces of the amber
                Ghur. As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer –1 SL penalty
                to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point
                on the location with the most armour. Casters with the Arcane
                Magic (Metal) Talent may wear metal armour without penalty;
                those with Arcane Magic (Beasts) Talent may ignore penalties

                If you win the Opposed Test, you dispel the incoming spell; if
                you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine
                whether the casting was successful as normal. You may only

                For the few Humans blessed — or cursed, depending upon your 
                point of view — with the spark of magic, it generally manifests 
                around puberty, and almost always before 25 summers have 
                passed. The first indications of impending witchery are often 
                little tricks, knacks, cantrips, or similar, showing the wizard-to-be

                For Elves, this is just a part of growing up, and those with interest 
                in magic are schooled to develop their burgeoning talents. For 
                Humans, assuming they avoid being lynched, it likely means 
                years of training as an apprentice to a wizard from one of the

            The Hedgefolk believe their Lore is a gift from the Gods, 
            referring to their spellcasters as the Blessed Few. Due to their 
            ancient traditions and ingrained belief, their spells cannot be 
            cast without ingredients, which are an integral part of their 
            spellcasting process.
            </p> 
            <p class="card-text">
            Fortunately, the ingredients they use are easily found on the 
            fringes of settlements and are usually herbs or plants. You receive 
            1 + SL ingredients on a successful foraging roll, using Lore 
            (Herbalism), as described under Gathering Food and Herbs on 
            page 127, or you can buy them for 5 brass pennies each.
            Ingredients: Hedgefolk use easily sourced local materials 
            prepared to exacting standards using special tools. So, ingredients 
            may include things such as the wings of a dragonfly killed with a 
            silver pin, rods of poplar polished with beeswax on Sonnstill, or 
            bones buried beneath a hedgerow for a winter’s month.

            <p class="card-text">
            Spells from the Lore of Witchcraft draw on whichever winds 
            of magic are available, without care or concern for mingling the 
            winds and the potentially horrific results. Each time practitioners 
            of Witchcraft roll on a Miscast table, they also gain 1 Corruption 
            point. Further, you may inflict one Bleeding Condition on anyone 
            targeted by spells from the Lore of Witchcraft. Lastly, channelling 
            or casting spells from this Lore automatically require a roll on 
            the Minor Miscast table unless cast with an ingredient , where 
            the ingredient provides no further protection should you roll a 
            Miscast. Fortunately, ingredients for the Lore of Witchcraft are 
            cheap and readily available: body parts of small animals for the 
            most part. Ingredients cost a spell’s CN in brass pennies, instead 
            of silver shillings, to purchase. Alternatively, a Witch may forage 
            for parts, using the Outdoor Survival skill: a successful foraging 
            roll receives 1 + SL ingredients, as described under Gathering 
            Food and Herbs on page 127.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
            Ingredients: Witches use a horrific mixture of animal body parts, 
            often harvested when a creature is still alive. It is not uncommon to 
            find them clutching lizard eyes, dog toes, donkey gizzard, or much, 
            much worse in their bloody hands as they cast their foul magics.
